## 🧠 Architecture & Animations

The **animation architecture** is powered by **GSAP** timelines with `ScrollTrigger` integration.
Key highlights:

- **Section-based triggers** for pinned scenes
- **Video + mask reveals** synchronized with scroll
- **Responsive animation breakpoints** via `useMediaQuery`
- **Optimized timeline flow** for performance

Each visual section (like “Showcase”, “Hero”, or “Performance”) has its own **animation sequence** and is controlled declaratively via React hooks.
